# presentations
A repo for content from various presentations I've done

* **bucks-mont-tech-extjs** - In February 2016 I spoke at the Bucks County JavaScript meetup to give an introduction to Sench ExtJS. This was a basic, introductory-level talk about ExtJS where I presented a number of simple examples and provided an overview of what ExtJS can do.
  
* **bucks-mont-tech-webix** - In May 2018 I spoke at the Bucks-Mont Technology meetup to give an introduction to Webix. This was a basic, introductory-level talk about the library where I presented a an overview of what Webix can do by way of a multi-user trivia app that was used to decide who got copies of my Webix book!

* **capital-district-dwr** - This was a presentation given on June 2009 to the Capital District Java Developers Network on the DWR (Direct Web Remoting) library.

* **philly-jug-android** - In December 2011 I spoke at the Philadelphia Java User's Group (Philly JUG) on Android development. This was a fairly basic, introductory-level talk, with a little bit more advanced stuff towards the end. Included here in the download is the slide deck as well as all example code.
  
* **philly-jug-dwr** - This was a presentation given on March 2009 to the Philadelphia Java User's Group on the DWR (Direct Web Remoting) library.

* **pre-dev-camp-webos** - This was a presentation given on June 2010 at the Baltimore preDevCamp on getting started in game development for Palm's webOS. There's some pictures floating around too (I'm in a few).

* **senchacon-extjs** - In October 2010 I was a speaker at SenchaCon in San Francisco where I gave a wide-ranging talk entitled "ExtJS - Tales From the Real World" where I discuss my experience using ExtJS doing enterprise development, some of the challenges I've faced and some of the solutions to them, some of which are fairly unique (and at least one is a bit controversial!). For some reason none of the materials from my talk were posted, including the video of it, so here's the slide desk at least.
