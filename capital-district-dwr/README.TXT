Here you will find the slideshow and all source from the Albany JUG
DWR presentation of 6/18/2009 by Frank W. Zammetti

Included is Tomcat 6.0.13.  You should be able to simply run
tomcat\bin\startup.bat, assuming you're on a Windows system (you
*nix folks are on your own!)

The starttc.bat file can also be run, assuming you have a file
java6.bat along the path that sets up JDK 1.6.

The rebuild.bat file will rebuild all the webapps and do some
other cleanup (mostly for me before I check anything into SVN).

The source for all the webapps can be found in XXX\WEB-INF\src,
where XXX is the name of the webapp referenced in the slideshow
(look in the upper right-hand corner of certain slides).
